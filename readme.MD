According to the instructions given on Canvas, the README.md should include the following:

An explanation of the organization and name scheme for the workspace:

    This project is going to be a silent auction. With this, up to 300 users should be able to bid on an item at a time. 
    
Version-control procedures:

    For version control, each issue completed will increment the current version by 0.1. A major release to deployment will increment the verion of the project by 1. So, a minor bug fix or feature will raise the project from 4.5 to 4.6 whereas a major feature will set the version from 4.6 to 5.0. Version control will also be ensured by using GitHub to ensure that changes are tracked properly.

Tool stack description and setup procedure:

    Our tool stack is going to be Java as our backend using Springboot for our framework. For front-end, we'll use JavaScript with django as our frame work.

    We'llbe using Java 11, with the accompanying Springboot with version 2.1.8 installed. FOr the front end, we'll use JavaScript 1.8.5 and version 2.2.5 for Django.

Build instructions:

    To build our project, first download and import the project into an IDE, like eclipse or IntelliJ. For example, Eclipse users can select Import…​ → Existing Maven Projects from the File menu.

    However, it is also possible to run the project as a Jar by typing java -jar src/driver.jar

Unit testing instructions:

    For unit testing, JUNit will be used. This allows the classes to be easily tested, with additional tests added or removed based off changes to the source code. We hope to achieve 80% coverage as a minimum.

System testing instructions:

    System testing is where the whole app is run from the beginning to the end of the system. Automation would be desired, similar to Unit tests. However, most of the testing will most likely be performed by the developers as each feature is added to functionality.
