According to the instructions given on Canvas, the README.md should include the following:

An explanation of the organization and name scheme for the workspace:
Version-control procedures:

    For version control, each issue completed will increment the current version by 0.1. A major release to deployment will increment the verion of the project by 1. So, a minor bug fix or feature will raise the project from 4.5 to 4.6 whereas a major feature will set the version from 4.6 to 5.0. Version control will also be ensured by using GitHub to ensure that changes are tracked properly.

Tool stack description and setup procedure:

Build instructions:

Unit testing instructions:

    For unit testing, JUNit will be used. This allows the classes to be easily tested, with additional tests added or removed based off changes to the source code. We hope to achieve 80% coverage as a minimum.

System testing instructions:

    System testing is where the whole app is run from the beginning to the end of the system. Automation would be desired, similar to Unit tests. However, most of the testing will most likely be performed by the developers as each feature is added to functionality.
